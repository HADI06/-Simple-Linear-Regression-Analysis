# -Simple-Linear-Regression-Analysis
Welcome to the Simple Linear Regression Analysis repository! This collection of Python scripts helps you understand and use Simple Linear Regression. The focus is on exploring the relationship between study hours and scores using a student scores dataset with the scikit-learn library.
What's Inside:
Importing Libraries:

Importing key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Data Setup:

Loading the student scores dataset and looking at the initial details.
Seeing the connection between study hours and scores via a scatter plot.
Train-Test Split:

Splitting the dataset for training and testing to evaluate our model.
Linear Regression Model:

Creating and fitting a Simple Linear Regression model on the training set.
Checking out the intercept, coefficient, and plotting the regression line.
Predictions and Evaluation:

Predicting scores for the test set and evaluating the model with R-squared, MAE, and RMSE.
Visualizing actual vs. predicted values for better insights.
Cross Validation:

Testing our model's performance across different parts of the dataset.
